**Section 4:** Will cover the use of smart devices by homeless individuals in Houston in order to get them off the street.

**Section 5:** will cover the creation of a hypothical nonprofit called The Texas Homeless Innovation Center.

These components are intended to be modular so they can be quickly put to use as they are rolled out but also intended to work together in a system that can be implemented as a package. The following infographic is offered to explain how they will work together.

**MAP TUTORIAL**

The following tutorial covers how to use the Houston Homeless Map. It is 30 seconds long **this isn’t the real tutorial, it’s still in construction.**

I also want to add a feed to the map based on mobile feedings similar to mobile loaves and fishes as seen here: http://mlf.org/truck-schedules/ 

**GOOGLE + SOCIAL MEDIA SITE**
Go to the Houston Homeless Map Community Google + site 

**SMART DEVICES**
As part of the project we will look to provide homeless with Smartphone or smartdevices.
I will add to this section soon. I was working on this before seeing this article but was influenced by this work especially for the idea of the Texas Homeless Innovation Center. https://www.aei.org/publication/a-tech-revolution-for-the-homeless/

**TEXAS HOMELESS INNOVATION CENTER**<br>
The Homeless Innovation Center could be funded by multiple levels of government and/or private donors. Its major tasks would include:<br>
• Managing the data collected from smartphones,<br>

• Developing algorithms for assisting the homeless in making decisions and evaluating service providers,<br>

• Developing and implementing a policy-centric research agenda including data analysis and randomized controlled trials,<br>

• Dynamically incorporating evidence into individualized packages of interventions for homeless individuals, and<br>

• Implementing dynamic interventions.<br>
